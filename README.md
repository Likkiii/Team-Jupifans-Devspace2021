Track-2: Education Technology
Problem statement-1: Develop tools that would increase Productivity for students and teachers.
Our Project Idea: Interactive Online White Board for Doubt Clarification.

Why we chose this topic:
•	Being students, we personally feel like most of the doubts we asked during our online classes are not answered properly. The major cause of this being the inability of the teacher to understand our doubts as they are unable to visualise it. A simple solution to this would be to provide an easy access virtual white board for the students to express their thoughts in a better way.

Features:
1.	White Board can be shared with the help of a link.
2.	Person who creates the link becomes the admin and distributes the link to his class.
3.	The link opens up a website that has a login page where the student is required to enter his/her name alone.
4.	 It then provides a virtual white board along with a note making column and a live chat for real time communication with peers and the class teacher.
5.	On having a doubt, a particular student raises his/her hand and waits for the teacher to give them access to the white board.
6.	On gaining access, the student can proceed to draw out his/her doubt and make it easily understandable for the teacher and the he/she can go ahead and explain that very doubt on the same virtual white board.
7.	During this time, the white board will be visible to all the other students who may have had a similar doubt, thus clarifying the concepts further.
8.	An option will be provided to copy(download) all the notes taken during the session which can then be stored based on the student’s convenience.
